    <h2>Asher Stumpf</h2>
    </p>Hi everyone! My name is Asher Stumpf. I am a computer science major. I live in Santa Barbara California but I am originally from Dallas Texas. I am taking this course because it requires my computer science degree. When I graduate with my degree, I will want to have completed at least one internship in which I would be invited to come back and work. From there I would continue to build my portfolio and gain experience. I would want to work my way up and eventually get into a large corporate coding job or into video game development with some of my favorite game developers.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for my entire life. 20 Years I have been in the church. It has bee a blessing.</p>
