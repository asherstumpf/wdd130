        <p id="rides5"> <em>Rafting</em> By choosing rafting, you will have the normal rafting experience with a team of 4-7 depending on your party size. Although many of the more entry-level low-cost manufacturers still employ bonded rubber, modern whitewater rafts are often manufactured from sophisticated nylon or Kevlar infused resins like PVC or urethane. When compared to traditional rubber rafts, plastic is often more resilient, longer-lasting, and just as easy to repair. Paddles and oars are the most common means of raft propulsion, and they come in a variety of sizes and styles to suit different river conditions. With Dry Oar, we use the safest materials for our rafts so that you can navigate through the rapids with no problem

        <p id="rides6"><em>Tubing</em> The real fun comes over stretches of tumbling white water that shoot you through chutes and jiggle you over stretches of frothy waves. Floating down a lazy river in an inner tube is a relaxing way to spend a hot summer day, but the real fun comes over stretches of tumbling white water that shoot you through chutes and jiggle you over stretches of frothy waves. There are 191,000 miles of streams and rivers in Texas, so you'll have plenty of opportunities to put your tube on the water.

        <p id="rides7"><em>Kayaking</em> Here at Dry Oar, our final option that you can choose is our kayaking option. Don't have a group to go rafting? This option allows you to either fly solo, or with a partner down the rapids. This option gives you the thrill of a faster experience where you can control your own adventure. Be wary though, this option is not the safest for families with younger children as it requires more control. Our kayaks are made with the best materials and have been equipped with back rests for a more comfortable ride.
